# WordClock v2
Version 2 of the wordclock does some things different to version 1. For starters it uses a complete board of letters and only one led per letter. It has an almost more crossword like approach and is planned to be much clearer in readability. I set them up in such a way you should be able to change out the homey stuff and replace it with your own smarthome systems code. 

They are based on ESP32 chipsets with ws2812 leds.
